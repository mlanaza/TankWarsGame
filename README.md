# Tank Game 
- This is a game that I did for my class. The goal of this particular project is to practice OOP principles like polymorphism, encapsulation and reusability to use the code for another game.


## Game Instructions
What you are about to play is a simple tank game and before you do:  
It's a two player game
Player 1 Controls: WASD to move, Spacebar to shoot
Player 2 Controls: Arrow Keys to move, Enter to shoot
You either win by stealing the flag or killing your enemy(or in some cases, you both lose)
If you get a powerup, you get 5 rockets to used.
